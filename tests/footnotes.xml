	<para>
	  This is a test of footnotes<footnote><para>Those short
          explanations on the bottom of the page</para></footnote> extraction,
          since footnotes are not "final" (i.e. directly extracted) elements.
        </para>
	<para>
	  That means that if there is some ignorable content inside the footnote<footnote>
           <para>Remember?</para>
           <!-- nothing important -->
          </footnote>, they would still not be shown in the output.
           This also applies to other cases of nested tags, but it was
           originally reported against footnotes as bug #172784.
